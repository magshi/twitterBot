BotMaker
==========

In mid-March, a medium sized earthquake hit the Los Angeles area.  It's not a particularly uncommon thing, but there had been an earthquake-drought of sorts, so it warranted a write-up. The very first publication to break that story was the Los Angeles Times, [thanks to a news-writing bot written bot](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/03/17/quakebot_los_angeles_times_robot_journalist_writes_article_on_la_earthquake.html) written by Ken Schwencke, a journalist and programmer for the paper.

We're guessing that in the near future a lot more stories are going to be broken by bots. It's likely that the writers of those bots won't be journalists and they won't work for traditional news publications.  But it doesn't have to be that way.

Bots in Seconds
===============

The goal of botmaker is to make writing and deploying twitter bots dead simple. It's target audience is journalists who might be interested in automation but don't have the time or skills to build one from scratch.

If you can use a google spreadsheet, you can use BotMaker and roll your own Twitter bot.

Use Cases
==========
The public service use cases are easy to imagine: bots that tweet out crimes, environmental data, earthquakes.  Some of these exist right now.  But the very best use cases are the ones we or you haven't even thought of yet! If making a bot is easy and quick, then ideas can come to you on the fly. Do you have unused data sets waiting for a story? Maybe a bot can get that out.  Are you scraping a site to gather statistics? Make use of those individual data paints and feed them to your bot!
