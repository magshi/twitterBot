BotMaker
==========

In March, a medium-sized earthquake hit the Los Angeles area.  It's not a particularly uncommon thing, but there had been an earthquake-drought of sorts, so it warranted a write-up. The very first publication to break that story was the Los Angeles Times, [thanks to a news-writing bot written bot](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/03/17/quakebot_los_angeles_times_robot_journalist_writes_article_on_la_earthquake.html) written by Ken Schwencke, a journalist and programmer for the paper.

We're guessing that in the near future, a lot more stories will be broken by bots. It's likely that the writers of those bots won't be journalists and they won't work for traditional news publications.  But it doesn't have to be that way.

Anxiety
========
There's a lot of anxiety about bots in journalism. Journalists worry that bots might take their jobs one day. They think bots are antithetical to responsible journalism. We think it doesn't have to be that way.  We think bots should be about fun and exploration. Maybe someday the best bots will free the rest of us to focus on the stories that matter â€” the stories that use our full human faculties and require insight and judgment. For now, journalists just need to explore and have fun. 

Bots in Seconds
===============
The goal of BotMaker is to make writing and deploying Twitter bots dead simple. Its target audience is journalists who might be interested in automation, but don't have the time or skills to build one from scratch.

If you can use a Google spreadsheet, you can use BotMaker and roll your own Twitter bot.

Use Cases
============
The public service use cases are easy to imagine: bots that tweet out crimes, environmental data, earthquakes.  Some of these exist right now.  But the very best use cases are the ones we or you haven't even thought of yet! If making a bot is easy and quick, then ideas can come to you on the fly. Do you have unused data sets waiting for a story? Maybe a bot can get that out.  Are you scraping a site to gather statistics? Make use of those individual data paints and feed them to your bot!

How to Use
==========
BotMaker is a work in progress, but you should be able to get a version running on your system with a little work.

1. Make a twitter account
	- We used [this primer from Source](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/botmaking-primer/) for guidance. You'll need to register for an API key and copy your four authentication keys.

2. Plug in your key values on tweet.py
	- Using a code editor, you need to write your own values for:
		- API_KEY  
		- API_SECRET  
		- ACCESS_TOKEN  
		- ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET  

3. Load up a google spreadsheet
	- Change your sharing settings so that the doc is "Public on the Web."
	- You also need to "publish" your doc by hitting the "Publish to the Web" button under the "File" menu
  	-  Get your "key" from your spreadhseet's URL. That's the number between the '=' and the '#' in this example: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhjKa3sJb0yXdGpEVWJNUkZaUlRDRVZkQnlqbkZzdWc#gid=0

4. Clone a copy of the app in your desktop and run it using Python in your terminal
  	- BotMaker is dependent on Python and the Twython library, [available here](https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython).
